Hi. I came across your application 
when I was looking for a way to send an isapi 
command to trigger the alarm output of my camera. 
a little background. I got a hiwatch camera ds-I114w. 
it has a microphone, speaker and alarm input/output. 
I adapted it for an intercom in conjunction with 
tinycam on a smart TV. I turned off all the alarm input sensors on the camera. 
and in tinycam I set up wake-up and sound alerts based on motion. 
I chose On-camera motion sensor as the source. 
With these settings, when the alarm input closes, 
tinycam thinks that there is movement and wakes up the smart TV 
and opens the image. tinycam doesnâ€™t have exactly my camera, 
but I chose the first hikvision I came across 
and the interface has icons for turning on the microphone and speaker. 
and even send an audio file to the camera. 
but there is no way to send an isapi trigger to an alarm output. 
What needs to be added to your program 
to implement this?

tntnx. 

p.s. localization would be nice
